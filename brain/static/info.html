                <h1>Why am I receiving HTTP requests from this machine?</h1>
                <p>These HTTP requests are part of an Internet-wide research study being conducted by IT security scientists at the <a href="https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/">Ruhr University Bochum</a>, Germany. This research involves making benign HTTP requests to every domain in the <a href="https://tranco-list.eu/">Tranco top sites ranking</a>. By measuring the entire list of the most popular 1 million domains, we are able to study global trends in web security.</p>
                <p>We will never attempt to exploit security problems, guess passwords, or change device configurations. We only receive data that is publicly visible to anyone who visits your website.
                </p>
                <p>We are using the <a href="https://playwright.dev/">Playwright automation framework</a> to facilitate some of these scans. Playwright has been used for <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22playwright%22+%22web+security%22">dozens of peer-reviewed academic papers</a>.
